# MentalHealth@Work-Data

Assignment:
In my data analysis I chose the dataset [“OSMI Mental Health survey from 2016”](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016).
It is a survey containing over 1400 responses measuring frequency
of mental health problems among tech workers and company attitude towards these issues.
What I wanted to find out was if there are company related factors that are associated with
mood disorders like depression. To measure association I used the Cramer-V score and
permutation feature importance with a gradient boosting classifier.
Another question I answered additionally is if there are any other factors that are associated
with mood disorders, but have nothing to do with the work environment. I found out that the
country of work matters and family history. Note that this is not found in the video, since I
wanted to use the limited time to answer the first question in detail.
For visualization I learned how to use the software tableau in this project. I appended all
visualizations found in the video presentation and additional plots I needed for the research.

Which company related factors are associated with depression? Which other factors are associated with mood disorders?
